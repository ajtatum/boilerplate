# AJ's Homelab Boilerplate Templates

I started my homelab in 2021 with Synology DS720+. At the time, I was just looking for a NAS, but it opened the doors of self hosting & open source applications to me.

As I'm continuing down my journey, I figured I should take some time and upload some boilerplate templates that I'm using or have used to share with the community.

Also, you can visit my blog, [The Hyperfocus Lab](https://thehyperfocuslab.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=readme), to learn more about what I'm working on.

Thanks,

AJ Tatum
